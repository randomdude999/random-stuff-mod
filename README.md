# random_stuff

Some stuff YouTubers like AntVenom and Phoenix SC made, but this time with
forge.

Works in Minecraft 1.11+. (Same JAR for all versions)

## Installing

If you don't have it, download and install [Minecraft Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/).

Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/randomdude999/random-stuff-mod/releases).
Then just put it in your `mods` folder like any other mod.

## Features

The default settings are to disable all features, so you'll want to go to the
configuration screen and enable what you want.

* Change maximum cactus / sugar cane height
* Enable infinite chorus plants
* Enable sponges never getting wet
* Change water and lava interactions
* Change what water freezes into
* Change what the land is covered in when it snows
* Make more blocks flammable (and configure their burning/spread speed)
* Configure the block limit on pistons

## TODO:

* More falling blocks (Phoenix, if you read this, how did you do it?)
* Anti-gravity for falling blocks
* AntVenom's modding experiments
